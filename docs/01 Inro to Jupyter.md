But if you don't want to install Jupyter notebook on your device you go also head on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)

### Advantages of Google Colab

- It is pre-customised for ML Development.
- It has all the major ML packages installed and configured. You are just to code and run to get the output.
- Your code executes on GPUs.
